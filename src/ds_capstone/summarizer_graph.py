Summarizer Graph Module

This module implements an AI agent using LangGraph that can summarize text
and answer questions using available tools. The agent is built on top of
Ollama's language models and uses a graph-based approach to handle
conversation flow and tool usage.

Classes
-------
AgentState : TypedDict
    State representation for the conversational agent.
SummarizerAgent : class
    Main agent class that handles text summarization and tool-based queries.

Functions
---------
get_current_date : function
    Tool function that returns the current date.

Examples
--------
>>> agent = SummarizerAgent(model_name="phi3")
>>> response = agent.execute("What is today's date?")
>>> print(response)

    Represents the state of our conversational agent.

    This class defines the structure of the state that gets passed between
    nodes in the LangGraph. It maintains the conversation history using
    LangChain's message format.

    Attributes
    ----------
    messages : Annotated[list[BaseMessage], add_messages]
        The history of messages in the conversation. Uses LangChain's
        add_messages function to properly handle message accumulation
        and deduplication during graph execution.

    Notes
    -----
    The Annotated type with add_messages enables automatic message
    handling within the LangGraph framework, ensuring proper state

    ----------
    tools : list
        List of tools available to the agent for answering questions.
    llm : ChatOllama
        The language model instance used for text generation.
    model_with_tools : ChatOllama
        The language model bound with available tools.

        Router function to decide the next step in the conversation flow.
    sum_agent(state: AgentState) -> AgentState
        Main agent function that processes messages and generates responses.

        This method examines the last message in the conversation state to decide

        component of the LangGraph's conditional routing logic.

        Parameters
        ----------
